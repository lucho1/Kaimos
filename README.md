# Kaimos Engine
Kaimos Engine is, at the moment, a basic engine for educational purposes. It aims to be a 3D Geometry visualizer with a basic OpenGL renderer in order to act as a basis for the development of the End-of-Degree project of my degree at at the Videogames' Design and Development Degree in CITM-UPC

The purpose of the TFG is to build an advanced node-based Materials Editor in order to make the creation of materials and environments edition easy for anyone without having a deep understanding of the subject and without having to write any kind of code.


Kaimos Engine will support, in its first version, and apart of what's already mentioned, a basic events sytem, a geometry loader with full UI Support using Dear ImGui (making use of its plugins for docking and for the node/graph editor), an Entity Component System (ECS) with transformations based on glm math library and a cameras system.
