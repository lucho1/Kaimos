# Kaimos Engine
Kaimos Engine is, a basic engine for educational purposes. It aims to be a 3D Geometry visualizer with a basic OpenGL renderer in order to be a basis for the development of the Degree Thesis of my degree at at the Videogames' Design and Development Degree in CITM-UPC.

The purpose of the TFG is to build a node-based Material Editor (like the Unreal's one) in order to make the understanding and creation of materials and environments edition easy for anyone without having a deep understanding of the subject and without having to write any kind of code. As well, my purpose is to gather the documentation to made this in the mentioned thesis (found here).


Kaimos Engine will support, in its first version, and apart of what's already mentioned, a basic events sytem, a geometry loader with full UI Support using Dear ImGui (making use of its plugins for docking and for the node/graph editor), an Entity Component System (ECS) with transformations based on glm math library and a cameras system.

# Disclaimer
The core systems of Kaimos engine were made following a series of tutorials from YouTube that can be found [in this YouTube list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT). For this reason, Kaimos Engine could be considered a derivative work of the [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) made in the tutorial series, whose licence requires to retain a copy of the copyright notice of the original work, which can be found in the file named "LICENSE_HAZEL" in the very same directory than this README file.

In addition, the mentioned copyright notice requires to cause any modified files from the original source. These are the whole files, since they were made completely manually by the author of this repository (@lucho1), except that they were made following the aforementioned tutorial (its advices, its patterns...), which can lead to have a very similar code in many of the core files of the Kaimos Engine.

Finally, this repository is the project repository to host the practical or development part of a Degree Thesis (which can be found here) by the owner of this repository, Lucho Suaya, that consists on a Material Editor made on top of the Kaimos Engine. Let us guarantee that the parts concerning the important, key, or central files or systems for the project development (the ones that were object of the thesis) were not, under any circumstances, copies, modified or derivative works from any other source, they were completely made by the author with the investigations made for the thesis.
